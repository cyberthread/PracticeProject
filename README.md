# Practice Project

## Client: Elmendorf Enquirer
The Elmendorf Enquirer is a faux newspaper. The newspaper is imagined as a regional paper located in a (fake) smalll town called Elmendorf in Oswego County (in New York State) with a population of just under 20,000 people. The newspaper is non-partisan and focused on delivering balanced news coverage grounded in facts. The newspaper aquired another smalller paper in the region and is in the process of reorganizing. As part of this process the parent company has hired your design agency to do a redesign of their page templates in preparation for a shift to a new content management system. 

The client has requested the following templates:
- Article Page
- Section Landing Page (article list)

The templates should be:
- highly readable across screen sizes
- accessible and inclusive
- flexible and works with a variety of content
- designed with their aging population in mind
- perceived as contemporary and trustworthy

This project will be completed iteratively by implementing one features at a time. There will four formal reviews of the project.
- Version 1: HTML Markup of Article Pages
- Version 2: Typography and Images for Article Pages
- Version 3: Responsive Layout
- Version 4: Section Landing Page andd Wayfinding
